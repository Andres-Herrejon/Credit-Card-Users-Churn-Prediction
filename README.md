### Business Problem Overview and Solution Approach

   The Thera bank recently saw a steep decline in the number of users of their credit card, credit cards are a good
   source of income for banks because of different kinds of fees charged by the banks like annual fees, balance
   transfer fees, and cash advance fees, late payment fees, foreign transaction fees, and others. Some fees are
   charged to every user irrespective of usage, while others are charged under specified circumstances.
   Customers’ leaving credit cards services would lead bank to loss, so the bank wants to analyze the data of
   customers and identify the customers who will leave their credit card services and reason for same – so that
   bank could improve upon those areas
   The solution approach is to come up with a classification model that will help the bank improve its services so
   that customers do not renounce their credit cards.
